    <h1>Six Hours of Silence</h1>
    <p><em>Published by Signal Layer</em></p>

    <p>For over six hours, the price of a digital asset held within a narrow corridor: 0.006221 to 0.006233. No breakout. No panic. Just repetition.</p>

    <h2>Observed Behavior</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Repeated transactions at 0.006228 — 187K and 181K units</li>
      <li>Dense order clusters at 0.006221 (118K units) and 0.006222 (52K units)</li>
      <li>Stable open interest — no sudden shifts</li>
      <li>High volume, low volatility</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interpretation</h2>
    <p>This isn’t randomness. It’s a signal.</p>
    <p>When price remains static and large orders repeat at the same levels, it suggests accumulation. Someone is building a position — quietly, methodically.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Signals don’t always come with noise. Sometimes, silence is the loudest indicator.</p>
    <p>At Signal Layer, we read behavior — not charts. This is one of many patterns we document for strategic observation and future leverage.</p>
